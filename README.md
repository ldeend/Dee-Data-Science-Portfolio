# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is intended to showcase my data science projects and capabilities. I will have work related to data analysis, modeling, and machine learning.

## Planned Project Structure

Here is an outline of how this repository will be organized:

- `EDA` – Exploratory data analysis projects  
- `Visualizations` – Data visualizations
- `Models` – Statistical and machine learning models  

For each project, there will be a detailed README that includes the dataset, methodology, results, insights, and steps for reproducibility.
