# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is intended to showcase my data science projects and capabilities. I will have work related to data analysis, modeling, and machine learning.

## Planned Project Structure

Here is an outline of how this repository will be organized:

- `EDA` – Exploratory data analysis projects  
- `Visualizations` – Data visualizations
- `Models` – Statistical and machine learning models  

For each project, there will be a detailed README that includes the dataset, methodology, results, insights, and steps for reproducibility.


## College Basketball Stats Streamlit App

This is an interactive Streamlit app that allows users to look at and explore Division I Men's College Basketball teams and their stats via different filters. 
This project demonstrates skills in interactive data visualization, filtering, and building web apps in Python using Streamlit.  
Learn more about the app's features and how to launch it in the folder `basis_streamlit_app/`.
